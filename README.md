# go2ban
go2ban scans log files and takes actions based on anomalies discovered in them.  
It tries to mimic fail2ban functionality albeit with a much narrower scope as most probably  
actions will be just ip{6}tables related ones.  


go2ban wants to be a smallish guardian that keeps systems a bit safer   
by mitigating prolongued system attacks.
